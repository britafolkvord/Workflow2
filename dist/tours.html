          <p>
            This 6,4 km long route lets you enjoy a little of everything. It is very flat and easy, so even kids can join, and it
            takes you along the beach, through the woods, and also some quiet neighborhoods. There are plenty of places you can
            stop along the way if you need a break to take in the beauty of the nature, or if your childre wants to stop and play
            on the playgrounds.

          <p>
            This 7 km long route offers varied scenery and terrain. It will take you though forests, neighborhoods, schools and by
            the lake. If you want to get a look at a normal town and get the feel of everyday life in Norway, this is perfect.
            This is a fairly easy tour, that most people will have no difficulties completing.

          <h2>Egersund Town Center - Skadberg</h2>
          <p>
            This route is truly worth the 15 km journey. The end destination, Skadberg beach, is Egersund's best beach. After a
            while on the seat of your bike, the fresh ocean breeze will cool you right down. During the Norwegian summer months a
            dip in the open ocean after a little work-out is truly an enjoyable experience.
