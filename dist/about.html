          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            We at Re-Cycle strive to offer the best tours of the Norwegian landscape from the seat of a bike. Our company is run
            by an environmentally concious gruup of hobby cyclists, who believe that nature is best enjoyed when you can do so
            whilst preserving it.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            We have tours for everyone, whether you're an active cyclist or more of a couch potato. This wonderful part of Norway
            offers leisurely routs along the coastline where you can enjoy the wind in your hair and the sun on your face, and
            more challenging terrain up some of our many peaks and through green forrests. No matter your physical fittness, we
            can tailor a tour for you that we know you will like, and we will happily guide you on that tour.

              myself liking a cycling tour, but I highly recommend it. Norway is a beautiful country, and this has to be the best
              way to experince it!" <br />

              life-time experince, unless you're so fortunate to be living in Norway (which I'm now considering)." <br />- James,
